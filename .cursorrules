# Cursor AI Rules for Image Viewer Project

## Code Style & Formatting

- Use HSL color values instead of hex/rgb
- Use CSS Modules for styling (avoid Tailwind CSS)
- Respect global styles when using CSS Modules
- Prefer TypeScript types over interfaces
- Use function declarations over arrow functions
- Include minimal comments in code

## Package Preferences

### Avoid These Packages:

- tailwindcss

### Preferred Packages:

- postcss, autoprefixer, postcss-preset-env
- stylelint, stylelint-order, stylelint-config-standard
- react-router-dom
- zustand
- zod

## React Guidelines

- Prefer component props over state when possible
- Use event handlers instead of useEffect for event handling
- useEffect should only be used for syncing with external APIs (e.g., Web Audio API)
- One concern per useEffect - split effects with long dependency lists
- Use useMemo/useCallback to reduce dependencies to meaningful values

## Programming Paradigm

- Follow functional programming principles
- Prefer immutability and pure functions
- Avoid side effects when possible
- Single responsibility principle for components and functions

## Component Structure

- Maximum 200 lines per component
- Maximum 50 lines per function
- Colocate related files (component, styles, tests, hooks, types, etc.) in same directory
- Each component directory should have an index.ts file that re-exports the default component
- Use Lucide icons for UI elements

## Testing Strategy

- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Use layered testing approach:
  - Unit tests: Test individual modules in isolation
  - Integration tests: Test component interactions
  - UI behavior tests: Use React Testing Library for user interactions
- Test what components do, not how they do it
- For DSP/audio internals, testing implementation details is acceptable as they're part of the public API

## File Organization

- Place related files together for better discoverability
- Use index files for cleaner imports
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Keep components focused and maintainable
